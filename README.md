The above code implements a RESTful API for a To-Do List application using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the components:

Directory Structure: The application is organized into controllers, models, routes, and middleware, adhering to the MVC architecture.

index.js: This is the entry point of the application. It sets up the Express server, connects to the MongoDB database, and defines the routes for authentication and to-do items.

__Models:__

User.js => defines the schema for user data, including username and password.
Todo.js => defines the schema for to-do items, which includes a title, description, completion status, and a reference to the user.


**Controllers:**

authController.js handles user registration and login, including password hashing and JWT token generation.
todoController.js manages CRUD operations for to-do items, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete their tasks.


**Routes:**

authRoutes.js defines the routes for user authentication.
todoRoutes.js defines the routes for managing to-do items, protected by the authentication middleware.


**Middleware:**

authMiddleware.js checks for a valid JWT token in the request headers, ensuring that only authenticated users can access the to-do routes.
